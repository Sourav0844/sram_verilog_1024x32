# Introduction
   - Memory is a very basic element in any Digital electronic device which is used for digital data storage. Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) is a type of semiconductor memory      that uses bi-stable latching circuitry  to store each bit. 
   - This project describes a 1024 bit x 32 bit single-port SRAM design in Verilog HDL which performs the basic Read and Write Operation.For viewing the Output Timing diagrams,      an Open Source EDA platform was used with Free Simulators.
